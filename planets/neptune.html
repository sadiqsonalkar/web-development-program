<p>	Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. 
	In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
	Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. 
	Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. 
	Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km). 
	It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.
