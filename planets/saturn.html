    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
	It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. 
	It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive. 
	Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.
	Saturn's interior is probably composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). 
	This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. 
	Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.
