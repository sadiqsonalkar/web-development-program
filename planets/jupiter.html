	<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
	It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. 
	Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity.
	It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.
